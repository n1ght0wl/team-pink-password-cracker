## To do 

- due to parsing only json lists work for now - we could try to make this work universally (eg. with various lists?) 
- how shoudl we implement the password verifier? - pws in 100k list don't currently match verifying conditions 
- feedback if pw could not be hacked? 
- maybe **pwinput module** instead so *** displayed instead of pw completely hidden? 
- requirements.txt file 
- gui
- more sec considerations?
