## To do 

- due to parsing only json lists work for now - we could try to make this work universally (eg. with various lists?) DONE
- how shoudl we implement the password verifier? - pws in 100k list don't currently match verifying conditions 
- feedback if pw could not be hacked? DONE
- maybe **pwinput module** instead so *** displayed instead of pw completely hidden? DONE
- requirements.txt file 
- gui
- more sec considerations? 

## Requirements 

python >= 3.11.1

pwinput>=1.0.2

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
